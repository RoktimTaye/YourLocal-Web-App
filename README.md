# YourLocal: AI-Powered Fair Price Discovery for Groceries

A community-driven platform to combat overpricing and bring transparency to local grocery markets in Assam, India.

Ever moved to a new city and felt you were being overcharged for daily groceries? You're not alone. Price opacity exploits both consumers and honest local vendors. YourLocal is a prototype designed to solve this problem by leveraging community data and a powerful AI vision.

## üéØ The Grand Vision: AI-Powered Price Intelligence

Our ultimate goal is to create an intelligent price advisor, not just a static price list. The full YourLocal application is envisioned to work like this:

- **User Input**: A user selects their location (e.g., Guwahati) and a list of grocery items (e.g., tomatoes, potatoes).
- **AI Processing**: This request is sent to our backend, which queries a proprietary Machine Learning model trained on hyper-local, historical pricing data.
- **Intelligent Output**: The model doesn't just return a single price. It calculates and returns a fair market price range (e.g., Tomatoes: ‚Çπ20-‚Çπ30/kg) for each item.

This AI-driven approach transforms the app from a simple directory into a powerful decision-support tool that:

- **Detects Overpricing**: Instantly flags if a shop's price falls outside the fair range.
- **Forecasts Trends**: Helps consumers and farmers plan by predicting price movements.
- **Adapts Locally**: Understands that the fair price for tomatoes in Guwahati is different from Dibrugarh.
- **Builds Trust**: Empowers consumers to shop confidently and supports honest local vendors.
